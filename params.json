{"name":"Deeptools","tagline":"User-friendly tools for the normalization and visualization of deep-sequencing data.","body":"# Welcome to the **deepTools wiki**!\r\ndeepTools is a suite of user-friendly tools for the visualization, quality control and normalization of data from **high-throughput DNA sequencing experiments**.\r\n\r\ndeepTools offers multiple methods for **highly-customizable data visualization** that immensely aid hypothesis generation and data interpretation. It also offers all the tools needed to **create coverage files in standard bedGraph and bigWig file formats** allowing various normalization procedures and comparisons between two files (for example, treatment and control).\r\n\r\nThis wiki accompanies the code of deepTools that is continuously being developed and hosted here at github.\r\n\r\n## Quick navigation\r\n\r\n| About deepTools         | The Tools          |   Example Workflows   |    Technical Documentation            |    Galaxy           |\r\n|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------------------:|\r\n| [[/images/start_howWeUse.png]] | [[/images/start_tools.png]] | [[/images/start_examples.png]] | [[/images/start_technicalDocu.png]] |[[/images/start_Galaxy.png]] |\r\n|  [[About deepTools|About-deepTools]] | [[Tools Overview|Tools-details]] | [[Example Workflows|Example-workflows ]] |  [[Technical Documentation|Technical-documentation]]  |   [[Galaxy introduction|Galaxy]]  |\r\n|  Introducing deepTools - why we built it and what it does  |  Detailed information about the individual tools  | Step-by-step protocols of typical deepTools applications (for Galaxy and command line usage)  |   Information on technical requirements and how to install deepTools |  General introduction into deepTools Galaxy  |\r\n\r\n## How to get started?\r\nIf you are starting out with data analysis of data obtained through high-throughput sequencing (= massive parallel short read sequencing = deep sequencing = **n**ext-**g**eneration **s**equencing = NGS), we recommend to get familiar with deepTools and the concepts of NGS data analysis that we are incorporating (--> [[About deepTools|About-deepTools]], [[Tools Overview|Tools-details]]). Our [[Glossary | Glossary]] might also be helpful in case you get lost in NGS between BAMs, BEDs and bigWigs.\r\n\r\nTo get an idea of the analyses that can be performed using deepTools, please see the [[exemplary workflows|Example-workflows ]] and visit our public web server: [http://deeptools.ie-freiburg.mpg.de](http://deeptools.ie-freiburg.mpg.de).\r\n\r\nIf you already know that deepTools is exactly what you have been looking for, the information about the [[Installation|Technical-documentation]] is probably for you.\r\n\r\n## Need help with troubleshooting?\r\n\r\n* check our [[FAQ|FAQ]]\r\n* get in touch: deeptools@googlegroups.com\r\n\r\n\r\n[[/images/logo_mpi-ie.jpg]]","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
