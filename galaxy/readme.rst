Galaxy deeptools wrapper
========================

deepTools are user-friendly tools for the normalization and visualization of 
deep-sequencing data.
They address the challenge of visualizing the large amounts of data that are now
routinely generated from sequencing centers in a meaningful way. 
To do so, deepTools contain useful routines to process the mapped reads data 
through removal of duplicates and different filtering options to create coverage
files in standard bedGraph and bigWig file formats. deepTools allow the creation
of normalized coverage files or the comparison between two files 
(for example, treatment and control). Finally, using such normalized and 
standardized files, multiple visualizations can be created to identify 
enrichments with functional annotations of the genome. 
For a gallery of images that can be produced and a description 
of the tools see our poster_.
