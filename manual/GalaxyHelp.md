Using deepTools within Galaxy
=============================

We have a publicly available deepTools installation embedded within the Galaxy framework: __deeptools.ie-freiburg.mpg.de__

If you are _new to working with_ [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/ "General Galaxy website from Penn State") in general, please have a look at this brief [introduction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8DPnFM4SLr2MzRsb1hPMXBkN00/edit?usp=sharing "Intro into Galaxy").


If you just need a refresher of _how to upload data into Galaxy_, please have a look [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8DPnFM4SLr2MGI4cHFqVDRTVEE/edit?usp=sharing "Getting Data into Galaxy").

As high-throughput sequencing data relies on several specific _data formats_, we've compiled a short overview [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8DPnFM4SLr2UHY3cHNZdTFEcDg/edit?usp=sharing "NGS Data Formats").

And finally, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8DPnFM4SLr2M0lZYkl6UEw2WGs/edit?usp=sharing "Visual Manual of deepTools Galaxy") is a _manual that covers the basic functions of deepTools_, starting from an overview of a typical workflow of NGS data analysis and ending with several different examples to demonstrate the power of heatmaps and summary plots.
