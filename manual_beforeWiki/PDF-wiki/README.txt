the description of the k-means clustering for Galaxy is still missing!!!

[Here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8DPnFM4SLr2UjdYNkQ0dElEMm8/edit?usp=sharing "From aligned reads to coverage profiles using deepTools") are slides that we used for teaching at the University of Freiburg that contain more details on the deepTools usage and aims.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8DPnFM4SLr2UjdYNkQ0dElEMm8/edit?usp=sharing "How to get from aligned reads to coverage profiles using deepTools") you can download slides that we used for teaching. They contain additional details about how the coverage files are generated and normalized.


add
-----
- mention glossary in intro, file formats etc.
- mention that there is more help on the website
- mention that both command line and Galaxy hints will be given in the tutorial
- small version of the figure files
- increase margins: 80 for left and right, 70 for top and bottom (Tools --> Options --> File)
- remove lines above the links (bottom of each document)


perhaps separate QC, norm, visual to get them on separate pages?
